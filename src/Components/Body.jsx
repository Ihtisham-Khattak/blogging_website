            Kevin Hart’s
          </a>
          seven-episode Netflix dramatic mini-series, exists because of what
          happened to the stand-up comedian around the 2019 Oscars. If you
          remember, he was announced as the host of the event but then forced to
          step down after some homophobic tweets and stand-up bits surfaced.
          Three years later, Netflix has launched a series about a fictional
          version of Hart who makes some much bigger mistakes than the real one,
          of course, but the show lands in a tone-deaf place about cancel
          culture and how we never really know what’s going on behind the scenes
          in a celebrity’s life. It almost feels like "If you thought my tweets
          were bad ..." Worse than the funhouse mirror reflection of reality is
          the fact that this drama doesn’t have enough meat on its bones for
          seven (eight, really, since the first episode is double-length)
          chapters of television, and the story it does tell never once feels,
          well, “true.”

          The typically likable Hart attempts a change of pace here as the Kid,
          a Philly-raised stand-up (like Hart) who returns to his hometown for a
          show and reunites with his troublesome brother Carlton ({" "}
          <a href="#" className="underline decoration-sky-500 text-sky-500">
            Wesley Snipes
          </a>
          , so consistently the most interesting thing about this show that he
          almost makes it worth watching on his own). Carlton and Kid have had
          conflicts in the past (again, like Hart and his real brother) but seem
          to be getting along now, even if the older brother demands he have a
          “V.V.I.P. Room” backstage. That’s where the trouble starts as Carlton
          pushes Kid off the sobriety wagon, and the celebrity wakes up next to
          the body of a dead woman after a night of partying.

          Carlton knows what to do. He calls a fixer named Ari (a very fun{" "}

          ) to clean up the mess, but, of course, nothing goes as planned. Ari
          has some sociopathic brothers ({" "}

          and Chris Diamontopoulos) who get involved as “True Story” mostly
          consists of Carlton and Kid trying to clean up messes and making
          bigger ones in the process. It doesn’t help that Kid can’t really go
          to his regular support team, including manager Todd (

          (“Narcos”) think they’re saying about the dynamic between celebrities
          and those who love them the most. (Fans in this show are presented as
          stalkers or idiots, such as one who encounters Hart on a plane and
          decides it's fine to repeat a racist bit back to him.)

      {/* Fourth Paragraph */}
      <div className="py-2 lg:text-2xl text-xl">
        <p>
          One of the biggest problems with “True Story” is how it often feels
          like it wants to have it both ways in terms of how we’re supposed to
          feel about Kid. I don’t need a show to give me a moral roadmap, but I
          also don’t like it when it feels like the creators are indecisive
          about a character’s motivations. Is Kid a good guy caught up in a bad
          situation? Given some of the choices he makes, not really. He’s kind
          of a selfish jerk who values his career and safety over everything
          else. Imagine if “True Story” really leaned into that, presenting a
          celebrity whose entire value system has been crushed by the spotlight.
          There are times when it threatens to become that dark and way more
          interesting but then it pulls back, wanting us to see ourselves in Kid
          when almost no one would make some of the violent, selfish decisions
          he makes here.

      {/* Fifth Paragraph */}
      <div className="py-9"></div>
      <div className="lg:text-2xl text-xl">
        <p>
          It doesn’t help matters that “True Story” is another one of those
          streaming era ventures that should have been a Sundance feature film.
          It has a habit of introducing supporting characters who may as well be
          wearing signs that say, “We have no idea what to do with this person.”
          The most egregious example is Newsome’s Billie, who feels set up as a
          possible future star, someone who may someday have Kid opening for her
          instead, but then just disappears into the background. Adelstein,
          Diamontopoulos, and Ales are one-note. Only Snipes comes out blazing,
          finding wonderfully subtle beats to play in a show that very rarely
          feels anything less than superficial. He is such a charismatic and
          fascinating actor that he holds even the least believable scenes
          together.

          Most of all, there’s just not enough realistic human behavior here in
          a story that relies on coincidence and deep suspension of disbelief
          (especially regarding phones that are never locked nor uploading
          anything to a cloud). It is interesting to see Hart play unlikable and
          the show gains steam when he allows Kid to be a jerk, making one wish
          he could play a true anti-hero or even a villain in a future Netflix
          drama. Or, you know what, let’s give that show to Wesley Snipes
          instead.
